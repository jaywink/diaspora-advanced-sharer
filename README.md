# NOT COMPATIBLE with Firefox FF 52+ // NOT MAINTAINED

This add-on is basically legacy and will not be updated. The new Firefox requires rewriting add-on's as WebExtensions anyway.

I recommend using the native Firefox share feature, which has integration to the diaspora sharing service, if on FF56 or below. If on FF57 or above, [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/share-backported/) backports the share feature which was removed in FF57.

It basically does the same thing as this add-on did.

Share current page easily to Diaspora* social network.

Uses Diaspora* Advanced Sharer as a sharing service. The following features are currently supported:
- Title from current page
- URL from current page
- Selected text from current page (version 0.3+)
